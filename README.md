# FrontDesk AutoCID
![banner.png](assets/img/banner.png) 
FrontDesk AutoCID is a small Chrome extension that helps CID encoders and hotel receptionists avoid typing security codes into the CID website's login panel, enabling them to type a little less and work more. If that makes sense. Like, at all.


## How To Install:
1. Go to this [repo](https://www.github.com/knznsmn/autocid) (of course, what am I doing...)
2. Download the repository.
3. Extract the zipped repo you downloaded and save it to a nice location. You decide.
4. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
5. Activate the _**Developer Mode**_ and load the extension you downloaded by clicking on the "Load unpacked" button on the right side.
6. You'll now find the FrontDesk AutoCID among your installed extensions. You might want to pin it.
7. Click the extension icon to save the login details.

## To Use:
1. You need to save the login details by clicking on the FrontDesk AutoCID's icon on the toolbar.
2. After saving the username and the password. You only need to do this once.
3. Just click on any part of the login panel or press the `Enter` key to activate the auto-log in function.
3. That's probably all.
