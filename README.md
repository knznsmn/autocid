FrontDesk AutoCID is a small Chrome extension that helps CID encoders and hotel receptionists avoid typing security codes into the CID website's login panel, enabling them to type a little less and work more. If that makes sense. Like, at all.

To Do:

- [ ] Prepare a manual on how to install this.
- [ ] Drink coffee.
