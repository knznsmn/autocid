![banner.png](assets/img/banner.png) 
FrontDesk AutoCID is a small Chrome extension that helps CID encoders and hotel receptionists avoid typing security codes into the CID website's login panel, enabling them to type a little less and work more. If that makes sense. Like, at all.

2. Download the repository. 
3. Extract the downloaded zip file to a convenient location. 
4. Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/). 
5. Enable Developer Mode and load the extracted extension by clicking on the "Load unpacked" button on the top right.
